;;; Commentary:

;; This manual contains detailed information on all of the function, macro,
;; variable, and constant definitions in this repository.
;;
;; This is Version 1.0 of the shu elisp repository.
;;
;; What this document lacks lacks are detailed scenarios and work flows.  The
;; reader might well say that this is an interesting collection of parts, and
;; then go on to ask how to use it.  How does one use all of these things in a
;; coherent manner?
;;
;; I hope to address that in the near future.
;;
;; One thing I will mention is that the function SHU-CAPTURE-ALL-LATEX created
;; the entire LaTex users manual (shu-manual.tex) and the function
;; SHU-CAPTURE-ALL-MD created the entire markdown version of the users manual
;; (shu-manual.md).

;;; Code:

;; This file contains no code.  It is here only for the content of the Commentary
;; above
