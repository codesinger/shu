Things that I would like to do someday ...

- 13 Jan 2019 - Add a function that when sitting on an arbitrary file name in a
   buffer will open that file.  Right now shu-project can open a file that is part
   of a project.  This would be a simple function that tries to open the file if it
   looks like a file name.  An example might be:

  /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/string.g
