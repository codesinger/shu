Things that I would like to do someday ...

- 13 Jan 2019 - Add a function that when sitting on an arbitrary file name in a
   buffer will open that file.  Right now shu-project can open a file that is part
   of a project.  This would be a simple function that tries to open the file if it
   looks like a file name.  An example might be:

  /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/string.g



- 14 Jan 2019 - shu-replace-class-name calls shu-internal-replace-class-name to do
  the replacement.  But shu-internal-replace-class-name will not replace anything
  that is prefixed by ":".  That is because it was originally intended to add a
  namespace to a class and does not want to do that to a class that already has a
  namespace.  But in the case of class name replacement, we do want to replace
  qualified names.

- 16 Jan 2019 - shu-cpp-rmv-using will detect a class conflict if the same namespace
  is named twice, i.e. "using namespace std" twice in same file.  Need to filter
  duplicates before doing conflict checks.

- 16 Jan 2019 - shu-qualify-class name should put all of the classes into a single
  regexp.  That way you can do an entire file in one pass.  You find a match in the
  class name, look up its associated namespace, and then do the qulification.  So
  instead of one iteration per class or one iteration per namespace, you can do the
  entire thing in one iteration.  Use the logic from shu-cpp-rmv-blocked to build a
  reverse index of class to namespace.
