Things that I would like to do someday ...

- 13 Jan 2019 - Add a function that when sitting on an arbitrary file name in a
   buffer will open that file.  Right now shu-project can open a file that is part
   of a project.  This would be a simple function that tries to open the file if it
   looks like a file name.  An example might be:

  /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/string.g



- 14 Jan 2019 - shu-replace-class-name calls shu-internal-replace-class-name to do
  the replacement.  But shu-internal-replace-class-name will not replace anything
  that is prefixed by ":".  That is because it was originally intended to add a
  namespace to a class and does not want to do that to a class that already has a
  namespace.  But in the case of class name replacement, we do want to replace
  qualified names.

- 16 Jan 2019 - shu-cpp-rmv-using will detect a class conflict if the same namespace
  is named twice, i.e. "using namespace std" twice in same file.  Need to filter
  duplicates before doing conflict checks.
