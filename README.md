My personal Emacs configuration and useful lisp functions.

This repository is an ongoing project.  A colleague once asked me if I could let him
copy some of my Emacs lisp functions.  I discovered that all of my Emacs lisp code
was highly modular in the absolutely worst sense: Every file depended heavily on every
other file.  If you wanted to take some of the Emacs lisp code, you had to take all
of it and live with the fact that it completely changed the behavior of your own
personal Emacs.  That did not seem acceptable.  Hence this project.

The goal of this project is to split all of the Emacs lisp into stand alone, useful
things that can be copied piecemeal.  If you like one thing, you can take it and use
it without having to drag along everything else.

This is an incomplete work in progress.
