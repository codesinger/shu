For dealing with tokens ...

Perhaps have a tokenization function that omits comments as they
are encountered?  Could simplufy subsequent processing.

Think back to the parser from RTS in Roseville.  Build a set of patterns
to match

Pointer to object

  1. Unquoted token (name)
  2. Operator "*"
  3. Unquoted token (class name)
  4. Operator "::"
  5. Unquoted token (namespace)


Const pointer to object

  1. Unquoted token (name)
  1. Unquoted token ("const")
  2. Operator "*"
  3. Unquoted token (class name)
  4. Operator "::"
  5. Unquoted token (namespace)

WHen walking through a reerse list, the things in front of the token are the things
following it in the list and the things that come after the token are the things
that precede it in the list.
