For dealing with tokens ...

Perhaps have a tokenization function that omits comments as they
are encountered?  Could simplufy subsequent processing.

Think back to the parser from RTS in Roseville.  Build a set of patterns
to match

Pointer to object

  1. Unquoted token (name)
  2. Operator "*"
  3. Unquoted token (class name)
  4. Operator "::"
  5. Unquoted token (namespace)


Const pointer to object

  1. Unquoted token (name)
  1. Unquoted token ("const")
  2. Operator "*"
  3. Unquoted token (class name)
  4. Operator "::"
  5. Unquoted token (namespace)
